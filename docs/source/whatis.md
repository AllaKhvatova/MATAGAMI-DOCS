# Introduction

In general terms, a blockchain is an immutable transaction ledger, maintained
within a distributed network of _peer nodes_. These nodes each maintain a copy
of the ledger by applying transactions that have been validated by a _consensus
protocol_, grouped into blocks that include a hash that bind each block to the
preceding block.
